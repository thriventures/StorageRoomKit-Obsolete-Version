StorageRoomCatalog
=========================

StorageRoomCatalog is a small demo application that shows the usage of StorageRoomKit in an iOS application. It contains several independent examples.

Please contact us at team@storageroomapp.com if you are missing a specific example and we will try to extend this app.


Examples
-------------------------

* NSObject: Basic mapping operation onto a plain NSObject
* NSManagedObject: Basic mapping operation onto a NSManagedObject. Example of pagination.
* Browser: Browse all your StorageRoom Collections and Entries.
* CRUD: Create, update, reload and delete an Entry through the API.
* Associations: Drill down through multiple levels of Entries through Associations (Categories > Posts).
* SeededData: Deliver an application with seeded data and use delta-synchronization to keep the content up to date.
